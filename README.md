These Python scripts load a Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and runs it over 10 different classification algorithma to generate a comprehensive comparison between them. Not only does it save all the results in a text file, but it also has the capacity to save the plots of every ROC in the directory "output". It offers a streamlined approach to model evaluation for any machine learning enthusiast!

In a similar fashion, I created a Jupyter file that runs the same dataset and some of the models. That repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach if you are more interested in the data analysis and preparation.
